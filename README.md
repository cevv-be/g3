# G3: a flexible pure Javascript framework for steam gauge instrument panels

G3 (backronym: generic gauge grammar) is a flexible framework for designing and
running "steam gauge" instrument panels for flight (or other) simulators, like this
(or see [live demo](https://patricksurry.github.io/)):

G3 is part of a quixotic pandemic project to build a
[DHC-2 Beaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-2_Beaver)
cockpit simpit.
Although there are plenty of [alternatives](#resources)
for creating instrument panels,
I decided it would be fun to roll my own using [D3](https://d3js.org/).
After several iterations, I ended up very close to
the pattern suggested by
[Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/)
several years ago in
[Towards reusable charts](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/).

The base G3 package lets you define gauges and assemble them into control panels.
The G3-examples package also includes a bunch of predefined gauges and a few panels
that you can use or modify as desired.

- [Get started](#getting-started) by running a panel or designing a new gauge
- Give back by [contributing](#contributing) new gauges and panels

## Installing

TODO

```bash
npm install @patricksurry/g3
```

... or something like that

## Getting started

### Display an existing panel

Display your a predefined instrument panel with fake readings by pasting this HTML code into a file like `panel.html`:

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <script src="./g3-examples.min.js"></script>
        <script>
g3.panel('DHC2FlightPanel')('body');
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```


### Create a panel with existing gauges

### Display real metrics

### Core concepts

A *panel* is a container that presents a collection of *gauges*, 
and orchestrates the display of *metrics*,
normally retrieved by polling some external source.  
(It's also easy to generate fake metrics that vary over time for development purposes.)

A simple *gauge* displays some *metric*, 
using a *scale* to transform the raw metric 
and *indicate* that value on a local *axis*,
usually adorned with *ticks*, *labels* and other decorations.   
Typical "steam gauges" use a circular coordinate system and indicate
metric values using a rotating *pointer*.  
More complex gauges might display the same metric at several scales
(e.g. a clock with a second, minute and hour hand,
or an altimeter displaying hundreds, thousands and ten-thousands);
contain one or more sub-gauges that display different metrics
(like a combined oil and fuel temperature gauge);
or indicate values using text or color rather than a pointer.
Some gauges *auto-indicate*, in that the gauge itself 
tracks the metric value with respect to a fixed point, 
for example the pressure reading of a altimeter 
or the "day of month" of some watches
where the axis is rotated to be visible through a fixed window.

In order to keep things modular and separate gauge configuration
from usage in a specific panel, 
G3 uses the pattern of closures with getter-setter methods
suggested by [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/)

Each gauge registers interest in ...


Everything is a drawable function

```js
(selection, gauge) => { /* draw into selection, optionally using containing gauge information */}
```

### Create a new gauge

## Contributing

TODO - set up a development environment

## TODO

- more throw messages. e.g. for g.measure(2) should be g.measure()(2) type of 2 isn't function

- re-usability is not great, e.g. draw & modify different versions of a gauge, or reuse tick labeling components

- upright axis label style

- custom tick mark shape option for VSI arrows

- fix drop-shadow for window cutout in altitudeDHC2 - apply to mask?

- more pointer shapes, standardize names https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Watch_hands_styles_fr.svg

- Omega tachymeter example

- diff on prior metrics + warn on missing metric after first call?
